# Welcome to the TrackerWebApp Project

This project aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of nutrition and allows you to track your nutrients, calories, and overall dietary habits.

## Project Versions

There are two versions of this project:

1. **Original Version**
   - This is the first version of the project, which uses a non-reactive approach and a microservice architecture with a React client.

2. **Reactive Version**
   - This version utilizes Reactor Java, embracing the reactive programming paradigm. The reactive version is divided into two projects.

We hope you find this project useful for improving your nutritional knowledge and tracking your dietary intake effectively.
